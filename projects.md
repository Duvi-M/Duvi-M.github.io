Here are selected projects and research directions I’m working on.

## Featured

### 1) LoRA Fine-Tuning Research (Master’s thesis)
**Goal:** parameter-efficient adaptation of transformer models with reproducible experiments.  
**Topics:** PEFT, evaluation, ablations, training stability, inference efficiency.

- Notes: (add link later)
- Code: (GitHub link)
- Status: in progress

### 2) Kaggle — Titanic + structured ML baselines
**Goal:** clean baselines, proper validation, metric-driven iteration.  
**Topics:** EDA, leakage checks, cross-validation, feature engineering, model comparison.

- Notebook: (Kaggle link)
- Code: (GitHub link)

### 3) Data Engineering — ETL pipelines in Python
**Goal:** build reliable ingestion + transformation pipelines with data quality checks.  
**Topics:** batch ETL, logging, testing, schema validation, reproducibility.
